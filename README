# Mimo App

Official repository for all development on the Mimo App, both the customer
and salesperson facing versions.

Built on top of Expo and React Native, allowing portability to both iOS and
Android immediately.

## Requirements

There are not much of specific requirements here, other than any requirements
needed to run Expo. Ideally, Expo recommends avoiding `npm 5`, so make sure
you're running either `yarn` or `npm@4` for installing. To install, simply run
`npm install` in the appropriate directories. For more,

## How to Run

To run, there are basically two options: within the Expo app, and as standalone
apps. This is specific to Expo. Check out the following links for more:
